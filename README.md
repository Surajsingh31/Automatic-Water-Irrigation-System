# Automatic-Water-Irrigation-System
This Project explains how can we automtatically water a plant using Moistur Sensor, Arduino,single channel relay board and a motor.
In this Project,the components used are:
1. Arudino
2. Moisture Sensor
3. Single Channel Relay Board
4. Sumersible Motor
5. B-type usb cable
6. Jumpers Wire  

In this Project We water a plant or a Field on basis of Soil Moisture content of the Field. If soil is dry then the water sensor senses low water and will supply the water to the Field else will cut the supply of water to the field.
